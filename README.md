# hello-world

My name is Kevin Sana. I discovered GitHub through my continuous research into programming. I am very inexperienced in the moment, but I am sure that in time, I will become proficient in utilizing GitHub and programming.

I was first inspired to learn how to code, from playing the sims 4. I created a sim that was exactly like me and I put him into the "Tech Guru" Career branch. One of the requirements for attaining a promotion, was to increase your programming experience. I played the game long enough that I had maxed out my characters programming level to 10. By that time, the sim was able to create applications and video games. I instructed my character to create a mobile application and once he was complete, he would receive daily revenue from his application.

I thought to myself, "hey, that's a pretty easy way to make money. All he did was sit on the computer and type away." When I went to bed that evening, I couldn't stop thinking about the concept of programming an application. So, instead of sleeping. I picked up my phone and started doing research on programming and application developement. I thought about what I wanted to achieve, what I wanted to learn, what I wanted to do with programming. After watching countless videos, reading articles, and reviewing online communities about programming I decided that this was going to be something that I will do.

At first, I tried watching a couple of videos on "How to make an android application usin Java." I was very skeptical with the video that I was following, as I felt that i wasn't learning much. So I started looking for alternative learning methods. I concluded that the best way for me to learn how to program, is if I did while doing something I enjoyed. So I started researching on how to make video games.

I first started using the unity engine to start development on a 2D game. I watched videos on how to develop games and tried to follow along. There were instances where I was required to program components in C#, but I have no experience in the language and I had no idea what was going on in the videos and I didn't learn anything from it. Because of that, I was intimidated by programming. I still wanted to stick with game development though. So I decided to try using the Unreal Engine.

I chose the Unreal Engine, because it had a better game development workflow for game developers with little or no coding experience. This was because of their Blueprint system.

Blueprint is a visual scripting program that the engine uses to develope games. I worked on a 2D platformer game for over a week and half learning blueprint and became pretty confident with my project. However, I soon realized that I was very limited to what I could do using blueprint as opposed to if I were to program the game myself. I was limited because blueprint would take a lot more rescources to compile and run it's own code VS if I programmed the code instead.

I chose to give up the idea of an easy alternative to coding and decided I will most definitely stick with actual programming.

I switched back to the unity engine and rebuilt my project on the engine and this time, learning how to code in C# and actually understand it.

I was able to create a 2d platformer game where the character can be controlled to Run, Jump, Collide, and even attack enemies. I was also able to create enemies, who would take damage and when enough damage would be inflicted the enemy would die, and disappear. The player even had a functional health bar and upon losing all health, the game would restart.

With this prototype complete. I decided to halt production on the game and focus on learning how to program completely. I researched some more on where to start, which program is best for me to learn. I even looked up local software companies to see what they were looking for in a developer.

I have already started to learn Java, C#, and Python. But I barely scratched the surface on any of them.

Through my research, I have seen and heard several times, that Python is the recommended programming language that I should learn.

I stopped everything with my game development, learning java, learning C#. Then i switched my focus on learning Python. While watching videos online about starting python development I noticed GitHub was always recommended to use on almost every programming video.

Which explains why I am here now, following this tutorial, telling you my story as I start my journey on becoming a self taught programmer.
